Steps to play Pacman with your own ghosts.

1. Put a (1) header file with code for all ghosts in the directory
   YOUR_CODE_HERE. The filename should be ghost.h.  
2. Put a (1) implemenation file with code for each ghost in the directory
   YOUR_CODE_HERE
3. Do *not* move the main program och the given files to the directory.
4. Navigate to the directory with the Makefile and enter 'make' in the terminal.
5. Run the program with './pacman'.
6. Flee from your ghosts!

If you have issues with compiling the code, make sure that all the classes
and functions are called as described in the lab instructions. It's possible
to read through the game code and see what is expected. Primarily it's the
Code/ghost_wrapper.h and Code/game.h that are relevant.

If you still have issues after doing that, talk to an assistant.
